Buying a Chronograph? Here Are 10 Things You Should Know Sometimes, the analysis of which watch to buy proceeds little further than, “Wow, that one looks cool.” Chronographs, however, are often thought of as “tool watches,” and when it comes to tools, you want the right one for the job. To guide your choice, in this article from WatchTime’s February 2014 issue we offer 10 factors to consider when selecting a chronograph, to help make sure it suits your wants, and your needs. 1. It’s the Way That You Use It Salesman: “How will you use your chronograph?” Customer: “Use it? I hadn’t thought about that.” Chronographs are not just for timing races – they offer many practical uses. Tracking cooking times, parking meters, walks or runs, bike rides, exercise routines, meetings, and guaranteed pizza delivery are often cited. So is determining the shortest commuting route. With your chronograph, you can find out how long an “instant” oil change really takes. Or, try this: when they tell you your table will be ready in five minutes, press the start button. When your wife says she will be ready in five minutes, press the… no, wait, that’s a bad idea. Lawyers and others who sell units of time can track billable hours. Or you can pass the time by measuring intervals spent stuck in traffic, watching TV commercials, or waiting for the doctor/dentist. Activate your chronograph for a short time when you have an idea you want to remember. Later, when you see the odd elapsed time, it will jog your memory (assuming the idea is still in there). Other uses require that the watch have particular features. For example, most chronographs can’t be operated under water, and many can’t time hours-long events. Some chronographs are designed to run continuously, while others are not (more on this later). Choose carefully if these are features you desire. 2. Can You See Me Now? Legibility – the easy-to-read display of elapsed times – can no longer be taken for granted. In days gone by, manufacturers  assumed that chronographs would be used and relied upon, so legible elapsed times were a given. Today, elapsed-time indications are often sacrificed on the altar of fashion. Manufacturers will ditch them in a second for the sake of a design they think will induce the customer to say, “That one looks really cool,” and reach for his or her wallet. Hungry subdials: the IWC’s “eat” several chronograph seconds, while the Zenith’s eat each other. But you’ll want displays that are easy to make out when you’re using your chronograph, so pay attention to the dial, and especially to what’s missing. If you need to read the chronograph in the dark (we won’t ask what you might be timing), you’ll have to search even more diligently, as very few chronographs will suit your needs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next page  Join more than 75,000 watch collectors and get WatchTime's FREE newsletter today!

Writer-Producer Simon Kinberg Talks Potential 'FANTASTIC FOUR / X-MEN' Crossover Written by Christopher M The talk ever since Fox decided to move forward with their Fantastic Four reboot was that they would eventually crossover the characters with the X-Men franchise in some sort of super film like Avengers. EW was able to speak with the best person to know if this was happening, writer-producer Simon Kinberg responds to the crossover talk. “The reboot of FanFour really needed to work in and of itself,” he says. “We were doing something pretty radical with the tone of the movie.” Still, the opportunity for a crossover is there. “If we wanted to find a way to connect them to the X-Men, we could,” says the writer. “There’s a lot of precedent from the comics.” We know that X-Men/Fantastic Four producers like Hugh Jackman, Lauren Shuler Donner and Kinberg are friendly with Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige, but the studios themselves seemingly have some bad blood. While we're talking about Sony and Marvel working something out for sharing Spider-Man is looking more likely than ever before. Fox and Marvel working something out for those universes to become shared is a massive uphill battle, that seems less achievable for Marvel. A Fox crossover between their own Marvel franchises will eventually happen but at this point both franchises are set in two different time periods which could be a big problem, unless Reed Richards builds a time-machine. Fantastic Four 2 could set up a tiny opening for a crossover but from these statements from Simon give the impression the first film will be it's own thing. Over the last two years or so we've been getting conflicting reports about Fox's plans for their Marvel cinematic universe. Mark Millar was proclaiming himself as the mastermind behind Fox's Marvel cinematic universe and it's main consultant, but then we found out that he hadn't met Bryan Singer (Days of Future Past) or James Mangold (The Wolverine) until after they shot their films. This means that he really didn't even speaking to the filmmakers who were also shaping the script, no he didn't consult on the films. Sites ate up his original statements and were reporting Millar was indeed the brain-trust for the franchises, which was never really true. If anything can be said about Mark, he loves to get media to print his bullshit. He was the first person to start talking a crossover was in the works, but was never confirmed by other sources. Millar is out for Millar, and trying to make himself out to be this big industry insider because he's selling his comics as movie pitches to studios. He's way too busy with his own film projects at Fox and other studios, along with creating new comics to really have any sort time to give to these movies. Simon Kinberg is actually that mastermind that Millar was claiming he was, producing and directly writing the scripts for both X-Men and Fantastic Four movies. Kinberg isn't some piker, he's also writing and producing Star Wars franchises for Lucasfilm including canonical series Rebels. He's also godfathering Sony sci-fi films with Chappie and Elysium. If you're looking for Fox's creative hive that would put all these films into one universe, it would be led by Kinberg. At the moment it's looking like Simon is Fox's version of Kevin Feige.

Obama mingles with power brokers at Alfalfa Club luncheon WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama mingled with Washington power brokers at an Alfalfa Club luncheon.  The gathering was at the home of lawyer Vernon Jordan, a confidant to President Bill Clinton.  According to club history, the club is named after the alfalfa because the plant extends its roots far for a drink. The club's main event is an annual dinner where politicians and business leaders rub elbows and share some laughs — off limits to reporters. Obama doesn't plan to attend this year.  The organization has about 200 members, including former Presidents George H.W. and George W. Bush, Chief Justice John Roberts, Warren Buffett and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, who accompanied the president Saturday.  The New York Times says 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is to be inducted Saturday night.

Rory McIlroy Leads by four in Dubai Desert Classic Rory Mcllroy in action in Dubai on Saturday © AP  Dubai: Rory McIlroy gave the field a sliver of hope as he unexpectedly struggled on the back nine of his third round Saturday, but even then he will go into the final day of the Dubai Desert Classic leading by four shots.  McIlroy took apart the front nine of the Majlis course with five birdies in his first eight holes, but could add just one more to the tally in his last 10 holes.  The back nine of the Majlis course, with its three reachable par-5s, is considerably easier than the front.  And yet, what the world number one did very well was keep the bogeys out of his card for a second successive day.  A gutsy par save on the par-5 18th hole, where he had hit his second shot into the water but made an up-and-down from the drop zone, saw him close the day with a six-under par 66.  His three-day total now stands at 20-under par 196, four better than 26-year-old Dane Morten Orum Madsen, who shot a similar bogey-free 66 in the third round.  Lee Westwood, who did not make a single bogey in his first 44 holes of the tournament, doubled the par-4 ninth from the middle of the fairway and a third-round 69 was good only for a third place at 14-under par 202, six shots behind the leader.  Scotland's world number 34 and the defending champion, Stephen Gallacher will have his task cut out if he wants to join a select club of five players who have won the same tournament three successive times.  A mid-round wobble saw him make three bogeys over a stretch of five holes, and even though he recovered to shoot a two-under par 70, he is seven shots adrift of McIlroy.  Gallacher was tied alongside the English duo of Andy Sullivan, winner of South African Open earlier this year, and Race to Dubai leader Danny Willett, as well as Austria's in-form Bernd Wiesberger.  After a two-feet putt for birdie lipped out on the par-5 10th hole, McIlroy was clearly frustrated out there on the golf course as his efforts to increase the lead did not fructify.  However, he said the conditions on the back nine had become tougher.  "I didn't put a foot wrong on the front nine and when I missed that little short putt on ten, it seemed like that momentum I had, just sort of went away and I had to scramble a little bit for pars coming in," McIlroy said.  "The greens got firm and the wind got up a little bit so it was hard to get the ball close to the hole.  "You had to hit really quality shots to give yourself chances for birdies, and I didn't quite do that on the back nine like I did on the front."  - Bogey-free again -  McIlroy said it was important for him to make the par on the 18th.  "It meant a lot. To be bogey?free again today was important to me, especially when you're going out with the lead, not to make any mistakes makes it that much harder for anyone else.  "Just to get that up?and?down on the last was big for momentum going into tomorrow," he added.  "I've been in this position many times before, so I know the pitfalls that are waiting out there. It's just a matter of sticking to the same game plan, being aggressive, making committed swings and giving myself as many chances for birdies as I can."  Madsen, who followed up his nine-under par 63 on Friday with a 66, was mindful of the fact that he was going to be up against the world number one.  "Obviously, he's going to be tough to beat. He looks like he's playing pretty solidly out there, as well," said the Danish world number 194.  "I'm just going to go out tomorrow and see if I can play some of the same golf that I played today. I won't be too disappointed if I don't win tomorrow.  "I'll be happy if I do what I set out to do and play pretty solidly." 
Cubs legend Ernie Banks remembered for unwavering optimism CHICAGO (AP) — Fans and friends paid tribute to legendary Chicago Cubs slugger Ernie Banks on Saturday, recalling how he helped break baseball's color barrier during a Hall of Fame career in which he won over his teammates and an entire city with the unwavering optimism he brought to the game and life.  At a memorial service in a Chicago church, the buoyant man known as "Mr. Cub" was remembered for his character as much as his accomplishments on the ball field, including his 512 career home runs. Speaker after speaker recalled Banks' unflagging optimism and good cheer — he enthusiastically predicted each spring that his team would win the pennant — as well as his humility and care for others.  The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Banks "disarmed adversaries with optimism" and "branded goodwill." Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Banks was a "humble hero" who taught younger generations "how to play the game of life." Fellow Hall of Famer Fergie Jenkins said the unassuming, joyful Banks strove to be a good teammate, not a star.  Saturday would have been Banks' 84th birthday, and several speakers called on the crowd to celebrate his life, not mourn his passing. Banks, a two-time MVP, military veteran and winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, died Jan. 23 of a heart attack. His coffin, which was in front of the alter, was draped in a banner emblazoned with his jersey number, 14. A choir performed a rousing version of "This Little Light of Mine."  Jackson began by getting everyone to stand up and then leading them in a rousing round of applause to celebrate Banks' birthday. The civil rights leader noted that it was also the 150th anniversary of Congress passing the 13th amendment abolishing slavery.  "Smiling faces can sometimes conceal what's deep within," Jackson said, describing Banks' cheerfulness as a thermostat that "helped control the temperature" of his times.  Banks was the Cubs' first black player when he joined the team in 1953, six years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier.  Banks suffered the same racial taunts and indignities as other black players of his time, but if he ever got angry, he never seemed to show it. Emanuel noted that in his early years with the Cubs, Jim Crow laws kept Banks from staying at some of the hotels and eating at the same restaurants as his white teammates. But in a 19-year career full of amazing statistics, one of the most remarkable was that he was never ejected from a game.  Roosevelt Johnson, 45, arrived at Chicago's Fourth Presbyterian Church at 5:30 a.m. and was first in line.  "I wanted to pay my respects to a true icon of the sport," said Johnson, of Zion. He added that Banks' charm and the genuine interest he showed in others, always making eye contact, made him special.  Chicago native Estelle Martin, 56, said she loved to play baseball as a girl and collect baseball cards.  "I was a tomboy. Ernie Banks was my favorite. He was everybody's favorite," she said.  Banks' connection to the city was evident in the church, where the pews were filled with mourners of all ages. There were young fans who knew him only from grainy video clips and from his appearances at the ballpark after he retired, always with a smile, always chatting with fans.  But there were also older men, particularly older black men who remembered the days when Banks and others made history. While he wasn't the first African American to play in the majors, Banks was the first with the Cubs in what was one of the most segregated cities in the United States.  Banks was playing for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues when the Cubs purchased his contract for $10,000. He made his major league debut at shortstop and three days later hit his first home run.  With his play, particularly in the first chapters of his career when he was hitting home runs at a clip that no shortstop had ever hit them before, he simply won over a city.  After Saturday's service, a procession was to take "Mr. Cub" past his statue at Daley Plaza downtown and Wrigley Field's famed marquee at the corner of Clark and Addison on the city's North Side.  ___  Associated Press writer Don Babwin contributed to this report. 
First Look: Viola Davis goes vigilante in 'Lila and Eve' By AP Entertainment Writer PARK CITY, Utah (AP) - Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez are grief-stricken mothers in "Lila and Eve," which premiered Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival. Lila Wolcott (Davis) is broken when her 18-year-old son is gunned down in the street - an innocent victim in the wrong place at the wrong time. At a support group for parents of murdered children, she finds a kindred spirit in Eve (Lopez), who's more interested in getting justice than talking through her problems. While the local police established a task force to find the killer of a blond-haired cheerleader, Lila's son is among dozens of young black men caught in the drug-trade crossfire. "They don't even see us," Eve says. She and Lila start their own investigation, which gradually becomes more like a revenge mission. As the two women delve deeper into their search for the boy's killer, Lila begins to lose herself in increasingly risky behavior. The leader of the support group warns: "The grief of your loss can be so debilitating it can cloud your judgment." Grief motivates the two women to become vigilantes, and an unexpected twist in the story shows just how deep their pain runs. Davis, who is also a producer of the film, said she was drawn to the role because it brings to light something rarely discussed in violent American culture: How do parents whose children have been killed move on? "I thought it was a really honest depiction of the emotional journey that a parent would go through after having a child who was murdered," Davis said. "It didn't feel sensationalized to me. It felt real." She said the film is homage to these surviving parents. "We hear about murdered children all the time; and we see the pictures or the news reports of the parents and they cry and then it's over. You don't see them anymore," she said. "They're just forgotten. This film to me was a film that said: Where are they and what are they going through and what is their daily torture like?" ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy . 
Imagine Dragons' Bassist: Don't Make Seahawks The Hero magine Dragons bassist Ben McKee has a simple reason he wants the New England Patriots to win the Super Bowl - he doesn't want to see the Seattle Seahawks made into heroes.  McKee is a native of Forestville in Northern California and roots for the San Francisco 49ers. He doesn't want to see any good fortune visit a division rival, even if the Patriots have been criticized by some for playing an entire half of their last game with underinflated footballs.  "I would hate to see the Seahawks as heroes," McKee said on Friday before he and his band played the DirecTV Super Fan Fest in Glendale, Ariz.  Imagine Dragons won a Grammy Award for their song "Radioactive," and their next album, "Smoke + Mirrors," will be released on Feb. 17.  The following week, the band will play a show on a Southwest Airlines jet flying at 35,000 feet. A contest will begin next week in which a fan and three friends will be chosen for the airborne performance.  "We've definitely played stranger venues," McKee joked.  His bandmates chimed in with more quips, noting that they had played smaller venues and this time will have a captive audience.  Copyright Associated Press.  All rights reserved.
