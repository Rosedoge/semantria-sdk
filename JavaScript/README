Semantria SDK

Semantria is a text analytics and sentiment analysis API. It allows you to gain valuable insights from your unstructured text content by extracting entities, categories, topics, themes, facets, and sentiment. It is based on Lexalyticsâ€™ Salience engine, which is used by Oracle, Cisco, Salesforce.com, Lithium, and 50+ other leaders in the space.

The Semantria SDKs are the most convenient way to integrate with the Semantria API to build a continuous or high-volume application. The SDKs implement all available Semantria features and include some simple examples of their use. However, the examples are not intended to demonstrate the best practices for processing large volumes of data. Please contact Lexalytics for guidance if you plan to build your own application.

For small volume, or ad-hoc, interactive data exploration check out Semantria for Excel.

We provide SDKs for C++, .Net, Java, PHP, Python (2.x & 3.x), Ruby, Node.js, and JavaScript (browser based, can be easily ported to server-side).

A free trial is available at https://www.lexalytics.com/signup. Please visit https://semantria.readme.io/docs/ for integration information.
